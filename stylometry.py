Signal two: the style signal. ← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONE 4

Signal one reads the text for meaning. This one measures it *as text* - the
shape of it, without understanding a word.

Three measures are stubbed below because the brief names those three. They are
stubs, not implementations: what they compute is yours, and so is how you
combine them.

    sentence_length_spread   do sentences vary in length, or march in step?
    type_token_ratio         how much of the vocabulary repeats?
    punctuation_density      how much punctuation, and how varied?

Why these might differ between human and AI writing: generated prose tends
toward even, mid-length sentences and a narrower band of vocabulary, because
that's what "most likely next word" produces on average. Human writing is
lumpier - a three-word sentence next to a forty-word one.

⚠️ **The blind spot, which you have to name in Milestone 1.**

This signal cannot read. It has no idea what the text says. Anything that
changes the shape without changing the substance moves it - adding typos,
breaking up sentences, pasting in a quotation. That is a very cheap thing for
someone to do on purpose, and unit 8's attack set will do it to you.

Build each function on its own and call it from a terminal before you wire
anything together:

    """
    How much sentence length varies.

    Returns:
        A float. Decide yourself what scale it's on and which direction means
        "more human" - then write that down, because your combining rule
        depends on knowing it.

    A hint on what you're reaching for: the standard deviation of sentence
    lengths, probably divided by the mean so a long text and a short one are
    comparable. `statistics.stdev` is imported for you.

    Watch the edge case: a one-sentence submission has no spread at all, and
    `stdev` raises on fewer than two values. Decide what that should return
    before the attack set decides for you.

def type_token_ratio(text: str) -> float:

    Unique words over total words.

    Returns:
        A float between 0 and 1. Higher means more varied vocabulary.

    Worth knowing before you rely on it: this measure falls as text gets
    longer, because common words repeat. Two texts of different lengths aren't
    directly comparable on it, and if your test inputs vary a lot in length,
    that alone can look like a signal.

    Returns:
        A float. Whether you count all punctuation or only some kinds - commas,
        semicolons, dashes - is a real choice. Semicolons and em dashes are
        more interesting than full stops, because they vary more between
        writers.

# ── Combining them ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def style_signal(text: str) -> float:
    """
    The style signal as a 0–1 score. **Higher means more likely AI.**

    Combine your three measures into one number. Same direction as
    `detector.model_signal`, so that `scoring.combine_signals` can treat them
    the same way - if one of your signals runs backwards, everything above it
    is wrong in a way that's hard to see.

    Two things to decide and write down:

      1. Which direction each measure points. Low spread means more AI-ish, so
         it needs flipping. Work out which of your three need that.
      2. How to get each onto a comparable scale. A raw type-token ratio sits
         between 0 and 1; a raw punctuation count doesn't. Adding them
         unscaled means whichever has the bigger numbers wins by default.

    Test it on the four calibration inputs from Milestone 4 - clearly AI,
    clearly human, plain conventional human writing, lightly-edited AI - before
    you trust it. Plain and ordinary, not formal: formal prose reads as *human*
    to signal one, and it is plain writing that gets accused.
